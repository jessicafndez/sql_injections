# sql_injections
Creating a web application to scan our database injection.

-SQL Query must follow the template: SELECT * FROM table WHERE x=?
-In develop: SELECT * FROM table

Common use on web applications searchers or login user forms.

Include a .txt template where easy add or replace injectors.

Also working on load injector results in .json file.

This is in work application, feel free to use just mention me.

Have a nice day.
